by Grant Sanders

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [PhoneGap for iPhone](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone).

1. Add the SMSComposer.h and SMSComposer.m files to your "Plugins" folder in your PhoneGap project
2. Add the SMSComposer.js files to your "www" folder on disk, and add a reference to the .js file after phonegap.js.

## RELEASE NOTES ##

### 201101112 ###
* Initial release
* Adds SMS text message composition in-app.
* Requires iOS 4.0 or higher. 
  Attempts to compose SMS text without running 4.0+ fails gracefully with a friendly message.

## EXAMPLE USAGE ##

* All parameters are optional.
window.plugins.smsComposer.showSMSComposer();


* Passing phone number and message.
window.plugins.smsComposer.showSMSComposer('3424221122', 'hello');

* Multiple recipents are separated by comma(s).
window.plugins.smsComposer.showSMSComposer('3424221122,2134463330', 'hello');


* showSMSComposerWithCB takes a callback as its first parameter.  
* 0, 1, 2, or 3 will be passed to the callback when the text message has been attempted.
<code>
window.plugins.smsComposer.showSMSComposerWithCB(function(result){

	if(result == 0)
		alert("Cancelled");
	else if(result == 1)
		alert("Sent");
	else if(result == 2)
		alert("Failed.");
	else if(result == 3)
		alert("Not Sent.");		

},'3424221122,2134463330', 'hello');
</code>

* A fully working example as index.html has been added to this repository.
